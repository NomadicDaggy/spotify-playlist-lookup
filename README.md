# Flask on docker

My step-through of this guide: https://github.com/testdrivenio/flask-on-docker

The app is visible at localhost:5000

## Usage

Requires docker and docker-compose

For running the development version see `dev_run.sh`

For production deployment use `prod_run.sh`, but that also requires `.env.prod` and `.env.prod.db` to be created and filled
